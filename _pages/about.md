I am a second-year Computer Science Ph.D Student at Stony Brook University. 
I work in the NetSys Lab with my advisor,[Aruna Balasubramanian](https://www3.cs.stonybrook.edu/~arunab/). 
My research interests include network performance, mainly peer-to-peer networks and decentralized distributed storage systems.
